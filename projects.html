    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <p>
        As a part of our curriculum, we have created plenty of projects so far. Here, are few of the projects created -

                            This project explores the various existing methodologies to state of charge estimation in Li-ion <br>
                            batteries and weighs out the pros and cons of the same. Finally, the project proposes a novel <br>
                            Deep Feedforward Neural Network (DFNN) approach and the comparative analysis is carried out.
